Automatically post your Instagram images to your WordPress site. Create new WordPress posts from your Instagram images, save the Instagram image to the media library.

== Description ==

Automatically post your [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) images to your WordPress site. When ever you post a new photo on Instagram, the plugin will create a post with the Instagram image caption as the title, and the Instagram image in the post content. Choose to save the Instagram image to the media library and set it as the featured image of the post.

No more [manual embedding Instagram images](https://intagrate.io/2020/03/how-to-embed-an-instagram-post-on-wordpress/) into your posts, let this plugin take care of it all.

1. Install the plugin
2. Log in to Instagram from the plugin's settings page

A new post will be created with each of the photos from Instagram. Simple, right?

I believe it should be easy to post your Instagram images to WordPress, without any manual effort. This plugin allows you to automatically integrate your Instagram images with your WordPress blog. What does this mean for you? A great way to republish your content on your site, or just create an awesome feed of photos in your site.

== Tell me more ==

Even though the plugin is simple to set up and get started with, there are some great features that allow you to customize how the plugin posts the images.

**What about saving the Instagram images to the WordPress Media Library?**

Yes it can do that! You can also choose to set the Instagram image as the post's featured image.

**Do I need to create an Instagram API app thingy?**

Nope, Intagrate is 100% compatible with the [new Facebook Instagram API](https://intagrate.io/?p=1510&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%20plugin%20listing&utm_campaign=intagrate-lite) and [Instagramâ€™s API terms](https://intagrate.io/2016/05/new-name-instagram-platform-compliance/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%20plugin%20listing&utm_campaign=intagrate-lite). You do not have to create your own API client.

**Can I customize the title of the post?**

Yes, you can. It defaults to the Instagram image title, but you can add custom text and embed the Instagram title using the `%%title%%` tag.

The [Pro version](https://intagrate.io/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%20plugin%20listing&utm_campaign=intagrate-lite) allows you to restrict the length of the caption.
